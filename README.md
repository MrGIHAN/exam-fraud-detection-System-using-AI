# 🎓 Enhancing E-learning Integrity through AI-Driven Fraud Detection

## 📑 Overview

Online assessments on e-learning platforms are increasingly vulnerable to cheating and fraudulent behavior, threatening the credibility of digital education. This project presents an AI-powered fraud detection system designed to reinforce the integrity of online assessments through **multimodal monitoring** and **advanced pattern recognition**.

### Key Features:

- **Screen & Keystroke Monitoring:** AI detects unauthorized activities and anomalous typing behavior.
- **Behavior & Voice Analysis:** Real-time facial expression, gaze, and voice monitoring to flag impersonation or external aid.
- **Prohibited Object & Multi-User Detection:** Computer vision to detect unauthorized objects and individuals.
- **Collaborative Cheating Detection:** NLP and statistical models analyze answer similarities and patterns.
- **Privacy-Conscious AI:** Edge processing with encryption ensures data privacy and secure detection.

Our goal is to provide **real-time alerts**, **scalable deployment**, and **explainable AI insights** to support educators and examiners in preserving academic honesty.

## 🔍 Research Problem

E-learning's growth has exposed examination systems to advanced cheating techniques. Current proctoring solutions are limited by:

- 🧠 **Sophisticated Cheating:** Screen sharing, VMs, and AI-aided tools.
- 👁️ **Single-Modality Monitoring:** Focused only on webcams or screen activity.
- 🔐 **Privacy Invasion:** Requiring intrusive personal data.
- ⚙️ **Poor Adaptability:** Fails to evolve with new cheating methods.
- 📈 **Scalability Limits:** Struggles to handle large, diverse user bases.

> 📌 **Objective:** Develop an AI-based, multimodal, privacy-preserving, and scalable fraud detection system that ensures fairness in online assessments.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A comprehensive, **AI-driven fraud detection system** that integrates:

- 🧠 **Multimodal Framework:** Screen, keystrokes, voice, facial cues.
- 🌀 **Advanced Pattern Recognition:** Deep learning for real-time anomaly detection.
- 🎯 **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamic detection based on user behavior.
- 🔒 **Edge Processing:** Local computation to safeguard user data.
- 🔍 **Explainable AI:** Transparent decision-making using SHAP, LIME.

This integrated approach overcomes the limitations of traditional proctoring by combining real-time behavioral and content analysis with ethical AI practices.
